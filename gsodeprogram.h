/*	CLASS DESCRIPTION
 *	=================
 *	The class represents programs based on GProgram, that trie
 *	to solve systems of ODE's. Every ode is first order and it
 *	has left boundary conditions.
 * */

/*	GSYSTEMFUN:	Function which represent the system of ODE's. The first
 *			argument is the number of the equations, the second is 
 *			the point at which we want to evaluate the system, the third
 *			argument is a table that holds the value of y's and the last
 *			parameter is a table that holds the value of derivatives of y's.
 *	GFSYSTEMFUN:	The same as above, but for the Fortran programming language.
 *	GSYSTEMF0:	Represents the boundary conditions for every ode in the system. The
 *			first parameter is the number of the ODE's and the second is a table
 *			that holds the values of y's at x=x0.
 *	GFSYSTEMF0:	The same as above, but for the Fortran programming language.

		 *	setGsystemFun(f):		  It sets the value of gsystemfun to f.
		 *	setGsystemF0(f):		  It sets the value of gsystemf0 to f.
		 *	getX0():			  It returns the left boundary.
		 *	getX1():			  It returns the right boundary.
		 *	getNode():			  It returns the amount of ODE's.
		 *	getNpoints():			  It returns the amount of the training points.
		 *	getF0(f):			  It returns in f the boundary conditions.
		 *	fitness(genome):		  It returns the fitness value asscociated with
		 *					  the integer array genome.
