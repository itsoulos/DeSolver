		 *	=============
		 *	GSymbol():			The constructor default of the class.
		 *	GSymbol(s,status):		The second constructor of the class. It
		 *				        set the name of the symbol to s and the 
		 *				        status of the symbol to status.
		 *	setName(s):			It sets the name of the symbol to s.
		 *	setTerminalStatus(status):	It sets the status of the class. If the value 
		 *	                                of status is 0, then the symbol is non - terminal, 
		 *	                                otherwise it is considered as terminal.
		 *	getTerminalStatus():		It returns the kind of the symbol.
		 *	addRule(r):			It adds the GRule pointed by r to the rule list. 
		 *					The value  of r must not be NULL.
		 *	cut(N):		        	It reduces the amount of rules of the symbol to N. 
		 *					If N is  greater than the current amount of rules, 
		 *					it does nothing.	
		 *	getRule(pos):			It returns the rule at position pos. If pos is 
		 *	                                less than zero or greater than the amount of rules, 
		 *	                                it returns NULL.
		 *	getCountRules():	 	It returns the amount of rules of the symbol.
